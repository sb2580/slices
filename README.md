# Density Slices through the SILCC Zoom simulation
This 3D visualization shows a moving slice (see slider) of the log-density, log(n/cm^{-3}), in the SILCC Zoom simulation.
The slice is parallel to the xy plane (the value of z is adjustable by the slider at the bottom). 
The spatial size of the simulation is Lx = Ly = Lz = 125 pc.
The color axes were set to saturate below -2 and above +2.

The visualization was made possible thanks to 
pycharm
